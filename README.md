# Standalone WatchPhone Framework

🕒 Ditch your smartphone, not its functionalities. This guide will help with transitioning to using a smartwatch as your primary device, independant from needing a smartphone. We're starting with the Galaxy Watch 5, but we're open to adding more models. Say goodbye to doom scrolling, hello to focused tech!


## Why Go Standalone?
Smartphones are great, but they can also be incredibly distracting. Using a smartwatch as a standalone device gives you essential functionalities without the temptation to dive into endless social media feeds or aimless games.


## Key Goals
1. **Complete Independence from Smartphone**: Your smartwatch should be able to function without needing to sync to your phone.
2. **Essential Features Only**: Prioritize features that you'll actually use and that enhance, rather than detract from, your life.
3. **Easy to Use**: The use of the watch should be as simple and immediate as possible.


## Essential Features
Here's a checklist of features that should ideally be supported by the smartwatch to make it a viable standalone device:

- 🎵 Online Music Services (e.g., Spotify)
- 🗺️ Map with GPS Location
- 📱 SMS
- 📞 Phone Calls
- 💬 Facebook Messenger
- 🟢 WhatsApp
- 💼 Slack
- 📧 Email
- 📒 Notetaking
