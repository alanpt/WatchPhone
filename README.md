# Standalone WatchPhone Framework

🕒 Ditch your smartphone, not its functionalities. 

This guide will help with transitioning to using a smartwatch as your primary device, independant from needing a smartphone. Starting with the Galaxy Watch 5, but open to adding other watches.


## Why Go Standalone?
Using a smartwatch as a standalone device gives you essential functionalities without the temptation to dive into endless social media feeds or aimless gaming.


## Key Goals
1. **Complete Independence** from Smartphone: The smartwatch should be able to function without needing to sync to your phone.
2. **Essential Features** only: Prioritize features that you'll actually use and that enhance, rather than detract from, your life.
3. **Ease of Use**: The use of the watch should be as simple and immediate as possible.
4. **Long Battery Life**: As long as possible

## Complete Independence**
There are non-brand watches that just require a sim card, but I have not tested those. The Galaxy Smart watch that has an eSim unfortunatly does need initial setting up on a smartphone. 

:Note The Galaxy Watch does not let you hotspot from it.

## Essential Features
Here's a checklist of features that should ideally be supported by the smartwatch to make it a viable standalone device:

- 🎵 Online Music Services (e.g., Spotify)
- 🗺️ Map with GPS Location
- 📱 SMS
- 📞 Phone Calls
- 💬 Facebook Messenger
- 🟢 WhatsApp
- 💼 Slack
- 📧 Email
- 📒 Notetaking

Not essential: Health features and notifications.
